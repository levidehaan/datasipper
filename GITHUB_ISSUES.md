# DataSipper GitHub Issues

## Critical Issues (Blocking Full Functionality)

### Issue #1: Missing Core Infrastructure Patches
**Priority**: Critical
**Labels**: `bug`, `infrastructure`, `core`

**Description:**
8 core infrastructure patches are referenced in the patch series but not implemented, preventing the data storage and processing pipeline from functioning.

**Missing Patches:**
- `core/datasipper/base-infrastructure.patch` - Core service initialization
- `core/datasipper/data-storage-infrastructure.patch` - SQLite database integration  
- `core/datasipper/memory-data-structures.patch` - Real-time event buffers
- `core/datasipper/configuration-system.patch` - Settings and persistence
- `core/datasipper/database-schema.patch` - Complete database structure
- `core/datasipper/data-storage-service.patch` - Service layer integration
- `core/datasipper/stream-selection-system.patch` - Data routing logic
- `core/datasipper/transformation-engine.patch` - Data processing pipeline

**Impact:** Prevents basic DataSipper functionality - network data cannot be stored or processed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All 8 patches are created and implement their intended functionality
- [ ] Patches apply cleanly to target Chromium version
- [ ] Data flows from network interception through storage to UI panel
- [ ] SQLite database is properly integrated with schema management
- [ ] Memory buffers handle high-volume traffic efficiently

### Issue #2: No Testing Framework Implementation
**Priority**: High
**Labels**: `testing`, `infrastructure`, `quality`

**Description:**
The comprehensive plan specifies extensive testing requirements (Section XII), but no testing framework has been implemented.

**Missing Testing Components:**
- Unit tests for network interception components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Browser tests for UI functionality  
- Performance regression testing
- WebUI tests for JavaScript components

**Impact:** No validation of functionality, high risk of regressions, difficult to maintain code quality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Unit test framework set up for C++ components
- [ ] Browser test framework for UI components
- [ ] Integration tests for complete data flow
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] CI/CD integration for automated testing
- [ ] Test coverage reporting

### Issue #3: Security Hardening Missing
**Priority**: High
**Labels**: `security`, `infrastructure`

**Description:**
The comprehensive plan specifies extensive security measures (Section X.C), but current implementation lacks security hardening.

**Missing Security Components:**
- Input validation for all Mojo interfaces
- Secure credential storage using `PasswordStoreInterface`
- JavaScript sandbox security for custom scripts
- Memory safety validation and audit
- Comprehensive security review

**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities, not suitable for production use, potential data exposure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All Mojo interfaces have input validation
- [ ] Credentials are stored securely using Chromium's PasswordStore
- [ ] JavaScript execution is properly sandboxed
- [ ] Memory safety audit completed
- [ ] Security penetration testing performed
- [ ] Security documentation updated

### Issue #4: Build System Not Compatible with Debian/Ubuntu
**Priority**: High
**Labels**: `build`, `infrastructure`, `ci-cd`

**Description:**
Current build scripts are designed for Arch Linux but the runtime environment appears to be Debian-based (GitHub runners/VMs).

**Problems:**
- `install-deps-arch.sh` uses `pacman` instead of `apt`
- Package names differ between Arch Linux and Debian/Ubuntu
- Build configuration may not work in Debian environment
- Docker may not be available in current runtime

**Impact:** Cannot build or test DataSipper in current environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `install-deps-debian.sh` script
- [ ] Update build scripts to detect and support Debian/Ubuntu
- [ ] Test build process in GitHub Actions environment
- [ ] Create fallback for environments without Docker
- [ ] Update documentation for multi-platform support

## High Priority Issues

### Issue #5: Alert System Not Implemented
**Priority**: Medium
**Labels**: `feature`, `alert-system`

**Description:**
The comprehensive plan includes a detailed alert system (Section VIII) but it's not implemented.

**Missing Components:**
- Rule engine with condition evaluation
- Browser notifications integration
- External HTTP POST actions
- JavaScript-based custom alert logic
- Debouncing and rate limiting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] C++ rule engine implemented
- [ ] Alert condition matching (regex, thresholds)
- [ ] Browser notification API integration
- [ ] HTTP POST action implementation
- [ ] JavaScript alert scripting support

---

### Issue #6: Custom JavaScript Forwarding Missing
**Priority**: Medium
**Labels**: `feature`, `javascript`, `forwarding`

**Description:**
Custom JavaScript forwarding with V8 isolates (Section IX.B) is not implemented.

**Missing Components:**
- V8 isolates for secure JavaScript execution
- Custom data processing scripts
- JavaScript SDK for common operations
- In-panel code editor

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] V8 isolate implementation for script execution
- [ ] JavaScript API for data access and forwarding
- [ ] Code editor integration in panel
- [ ] Security sandbox for user scripts
- [ ] JavaScript library/SDK documentation

---

### Issue #7: Performance Optimization Needed
**Priority**: Medium
**Labels**: `performance`, `optimization`

**Description:**
The comprehensive plan specifies detailed performance requirements, but current implementation needs profiling and optimization.

**Required Optimizations:**
- Memory usage profiling and optimization
- Background thread processing using `base::ThreadPool`
- IPC optimization for large data transfers
- CPU usage optimization for high-frequency events

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Performance profiling suite implemented
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for high-volume traffic
